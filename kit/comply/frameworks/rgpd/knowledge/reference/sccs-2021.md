> Effective: 27 June 2021
> Stability: Stable

## Overview

The 2021 SCCs replace the previous versions (2001, 2004, 2010) and must be used for new contracts. Existing contracts had until 27 December 2022 to transition.

**Key improvements:**
- Modular approach covering all transfer scenarios
- Aligned with GDPR requirements
- Addresses Schrems II concerns with new assessment obligations
- Supports multi-party arrangements (docking clause)

---

## Modules

### Module 1: Controller to Controller (C2C)

**Use case**: Transfer between two independent controllers

**Key clauses:**
- Each party determines purposes and means independently
- Data importer processes only for documented purposes
- Both parties must respond to data subject requests
- Joint liability to data subjects for damages

**When to use:** Sharing data with business partners, group companies acting as separate controllers, or data sharing agreements.

### Module 2: Controller to Processor (C2P)

**Use case**: Controller in EU, Processor outside EU

**Key clauses:**
- Processor acts only on controller's documented instructions
- Processor must ensure personnel confidentiality
- Security measures per Article 32 GDPR
- Sub-processor authorization and flow-down requirements
- Assistance with data subject rights and DPIAs
- Audit rights for controller
- Data return or deletion at end of services

**When to use:** Most common scenario - engaging cloud providers, SaaS vendors, or service providers outside EU/EEA.

### Module 3: Processor to Processor (P2P)

**Use case**: EU processor engaging non-EU sub-processor

**Key clauses:**
- Sub-processor bound by same obligations as processor
- Processor remains liable to controller for sub-processor's performance
- Flow-down of all relevant obligations from Module 2
- Controller must be informed of sub-processor engagement

**When to use:** When your EU-based processor uses a third-country sub-processor.

### Module 4: Processor to Controller (P2C)

**Use case**: Processor in EU, Controller outside EU (rare)

**Key clauses:**
- Data exporter (EU processor) transfers to data importer (non-EU controller)
- Controller determines purposes; processor follows instructions
- Applicable when EU entity processes on behalf of non-EU controller

**When to use:** Rare scenario, e.g., EU subsidiary processing for non-EU parent company acting as controller.

## Key Clauses

### Clause 14 - Local Laws and Government Access

**Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) requirements:**

1. **Prior assessment obligation** - Before transfer, parties must assess whether third country laws affect compliance
2. **Factors to consider:**
   - Specific circumstances of transfer (chain, recipients, purpose)
   - Laws and practices of third country (access laws, surveillance)
   - Contractual, technical, and organizational safeguards in place
3. **Documentation** - Assessment must be documented and available to supervisory authority
4. **Reassessment** - If circumstances change, reassess and notify other party
5. **Suspension** - If assessment shows inadequate protection, suspend transfer

**Practical steps:**
- Review third country surveillance laws
- Check for government access provisions
- Document supplementary measures applied
- Maintain evidence of assessment

### Clause 15 - Data Importer Obligations on Government Access

**Notification obligations:**
- Promptly notify data exporter of legally binding requests from public authorities
- If prohibited from notifying, use best efforts to obtain waiver
- Provide periodic summary information if direct notification impossible

**Challenge obligations:**
- Assess legality of disclosure request
- Challenge unlawful requests using available legal remedies
- Provide minimum information legally required

**Documentation:**
- Keep records of requests received and responses
- Make available to data exporter on request

### Clause 16 - Non-compliance and Termination

**If data importer cannot comply:**
1. Promptly inform data exporter of inability to comply
2. Data exporter must suspend transfer until compliance restored
3. Data exporter may terminate the contract regarding personal data processing

**Breach procedures:**
1. Notification without undue delay
2. Good faith efforts to remedy breach
3. Cooperation to mitigate adverse effects
4. If not remedied, data exporter may terminate

**Data subject rights:**
- Third-party beneficiary rights remain enforceable
- Data subjects may lodge complaints with supervisory authority
- May seek compensation for material or non-material damage

- No single entity has access to complete data
- Meaningful processing in EU with only partial transfer

### Organisational Measures

- Data localization where possible
- Strict need-to-know access

**Transparency reports:**
- Publish government access statistics
- Transparency about legal orders received
- Regular updates on legal environment

- Enable objection rights

### Contractual Measures

**Enhanced audit rights:**
- Unannounced audit capability
- Access to relevant systems and records
- Independent third-party audits

**Warrant canary clauses:**
- Transparency about absence of secret orders
- Notification commitments where legally possible
- Commitment to challenge orders

**Data localization commitments:**
- Store data in specific regions
- Process in specific jurisdictions

## Practical Implementation

### When SCCs Are Required

Transfer to third country **without** adequacy decision → SCCs or other Article 46 safeguard required.

### Choosing the Right Module

```
Is the data exporter a Controller?
├── Yes → Is data importer a Controller?
│         ├── Yes → Module 1 (C2C)
│         └── No  → Module 2 (C2P)
└── No  → Is data importer a Controller?
          ├── Yes → Module 4 (P2C)
          └── No  → Module 3 (P2P)
```

### Multi-party Arrangements

The **docking clause** (Clause 7) allows additional parties to join existing SCCs without re-executing the entire agreement.
